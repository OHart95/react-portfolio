I have over 10 years’ experience at **Skanska UK**, starting as a BIM Technician and progressing through data analytics and low-code development before moving into self-taught web development. I hold a degree in **Digital & Technology Solutions** and am currently studying for a **Master’s** in the same field.

This portfolio represents my transition into modern web development using React.

## 📌 Roadmap

* Add animations and micro-interactions
* Improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
* Expand project case studies
* Add testing
